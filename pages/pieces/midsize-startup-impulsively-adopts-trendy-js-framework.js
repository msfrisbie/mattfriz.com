    <p>
      PALO ALTO, CA - In a flailing attempt at reining in the company's frontend
      atrocity, technical cofounder Elliot Chandler revealed on Friday his
      decision to flush the majority of the company's client-side codebase down
      the proverbial toilet. The announcement was made to the technical staff
      during this week's engineering all-hands meeting, and was met with an
      especially enthusiastic reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the better part of a year, the startup had been keeping its
      higgledy-piggledy JavaScript monstrosity on life support - the bulk of
      which was inflicted by Chandler himself before the startup had raised any
      capital. New engineering hires did their best to triage code health while
      adding new features at a breakneck pace, but the priorities of the company
      - combined with the founders' intense focus on growth - resulted in a
      source code corpus that Chandler himself described as an outright
      calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the all-hands, Chandler remarked he had realized they reached an
      inflection point when the most contentious engineering issue was no longer
      their grotesque collage of deployment shell scripts. The team eagerly
      agreed, and added that their collective bellyaching, commiseration, and
      passive-aggressive commit messages had indeed surpassed critical mass.
      Emboldened by the blank slate before them, the team elected to spend the
      remainder of the meeting in a fiery and divisive debate about which
      framework-du-jour was sexy enough to merit selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on Friday, Chandler composed an email to the engineering team
      formalizing their choice, and giving general guidance as to how their
      existing scab of a codebase could be efficiently picked off. In the email,
      he encouraged the team to consider contributing to a future blog post
      about the company's decision to adopt this particular framework, which he
      insisted would help with recruiting and help spice up their snoozer of an
      engineering blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, Chandler was seen writing himself a reminder to think of
      ways to broaden the company's pathetic test coverage.
