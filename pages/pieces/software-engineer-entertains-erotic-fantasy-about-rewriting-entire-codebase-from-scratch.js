      Software Engineer Entertains Erotic Fantasy About Rewriting Entire
      Codebase From Scratch
    </h2>
    <h4>May 26, 2017</h4>

    <hr />
    <p>
      PALO ALTO - Already waist-deep in what was certain to be another daylong
      slog through the company's ghastly GitHub repository, fullstack engineer
      David Kemp indulged himself for a brief moment early Wednesday morning in
      a smutty fictional narrative where he scraps the entire codebase and
      rebuilds it exactly as he pleases. Reports indicated that Kemp momentarily
      gazed off in the distance and gently bit his lower lip as he envisioned
      himself nuking the company's gobbledygook source code and expertly
      crafting anew an idiomatic, elegant, and perfectly formatted replacement -
      replete with plentiful comments and edifying documentation.{" "}
    </p>

    <p>
      Kemp's colleagues described how the engineer's pupils dilated and
      respiration rate visibly increased as he visualized the fanciful and
      obscene fiction in which he discards 8,000 engineer-hours of work and
      heroically supplants it with the superior fruits of his fingers. When
      pressed on the matter, Kemp assured press members that he likely would
      never embark on such a naughty undertaking. The engineer underscored his
      intentions by presenting his "to do" list, which listed "rewrite entire
      codebase" fourth, following "swap from Heroku to big boy hosting", "ditch
      MongoDB", and "convert everything to microservices".
