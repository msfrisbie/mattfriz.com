      PALO ALTO - Enjoy working from home, but yearn for the interminable
      stimulation and irritation of an open office? There's an app for that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open Home Office, a phone app that brings the annoyance and distractions
      of open office layouts to anywhere someone is working, announced this week
      they successfully closed their Series A at an undisclosed valuation. The
      round, led by Andreessen Horowitz, is a stamp of legitimacy on yet another
      startup's foray into a market aiming to serve the growing segment of
      remote workers in the software industry. The company indicated the newly
      raised funding will be primarily used to grow their team and enhance their
      already robust featureset.{" "}
    </p>

    <p>
      Leonard Robinson, the company's CEO, described in an interview how
      important it was for the company to accurately replicate being shoved into
      a crowded pit of software development chaos. "The industry has spoken:
      open office plans are here to stay, but remote work is increasingly
      attractive as an alternative. Why shouldn't the workspaces of remote
      engineers be just as much of a nuisance as the company headquarters?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Available as a web app or on Apple and Android devices, Open Home Office
      runs in the background and uses sporadic audio, video, push notifications,
      and vibration to offer a shockingly realistic simulation of an open
      office. It utilizes a Perlin noise algorithm to generate unique and
      realistic constellations of hacking coughs, wet sneezes, open mouth
      chewing, bags of Sunchips being opened, an absent coworker's phone alarm
      going off on their desk that nobody nearby is volunteering to silence,
      distant toilet flushes, and soda cans being opened, among thousands of
      other sound options. It also allows you to create variable numbers of
      AutoCoworkers, each of which add to the ambient noise with customizable
      keystroke intensity and keyboard models - right down to the mechanical
      keyboard switches.{" "}
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, Open Home Office prides itself on ConvoGen, a product which
      uses machine learning to generate conversations based on topics that will
      maximally distract you when softly spoken in the background. Robinson
      indicated they are also working with a number of cross-application
      integrations, such as an email plugin that will simulate a colleague
      walking up to your desk and asking "did you get my email?".
    </p>

    <p>
      Open Home Office is also looking into simulation of office disease
      transmission. They are looking to form partnerships with biotech companies
      that can directly mail to remote workers strains of common illnesses in
      WiFi-enabled spritzer bottles that automatically dispense alongside
      sneezing or coughing audio.
