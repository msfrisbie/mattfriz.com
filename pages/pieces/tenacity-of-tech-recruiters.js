    <p>Hey there, LinkedIn keyword search result!</p>

      My name is Mosk Ito, I'm the head of talent acquisition for
      AlliterativePortmanteau. With all the precision you'd expect from a
      participant in a hot dog eating competition, I looked through your résumé
      and think you'd be a great fit based on your experience with a technology
      you haven't used in 7 years. If you have a minute, I'd love to butter you
      up with some grandiose fluff and cherrypicked statistics about the
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      AlliterativePortmanteau is still in "ultra-stealth mode", but we are the
      #1 mobile-first one-stop cloud-based marketplace collaboration app for
      social B2B wearable tech payments. In other words, we're making the next
      Facebook by building Pinterest on top of Dropbox using the Github API -
      and we're calling the new product DropFaceGitPinHubTrestBookBox. We've
      seen 400% growth over the first 38 months, we're growing like a weed,
      we're on pace to process over 800 million bytes of data this year alone,
      and we're exploding like a dying star.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early last year we raised our Series A from top investors and VCs such as
      Balsa Wood Capital, a24z, Laytu Thuggaim (58th investor in Palantir), Fred
      Iculous Stax (an eccentric tycoon in a completely separate industry), and
      Dawla Billyall (shook hands with Mark Zuckerberg once), who have backed
      companies like Zenebriated, SplitSwap, and 47stitches.

      You would work with our high-octane, driven, talented engineering team
      very closely - literally. They all share a single folding table. We value
      passionate individuals who want to make a difference in the world by
      propping up laughable business models with cookie cutter software.
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer market-rate salary, suspiciously generous equity packages, and a
      liquidation preference situation that could not be less desirable. Our
      beautiful and minimalistic office is located in the greater San Francisco
      area, offering a breathtaking view of an expansive tent city.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you don't email me back, I'll just keep sending you more or less the
      same email until you respond. And once you politely decline, I'll maintain
      my omnipresence in your inbox by asking for you to throw your colleagues
      under the bus by referring them to me in exchange for a dubious signing
      bonus.
    </p>
    <p>When can you start?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Looking forward to hearing from you,
      <br />
