    <h1>Tech Interview Torture Chamber</h1>
    <hr />
    <div className="text-2xl py-2">The Application Page</div>
    <p>
      When considering to submit an application, the candidate must feel like
      they are about to swab peroxide on an open wound.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Collect the resume</div>
    <p>
      Let them upload their resume, then force them to fill out an unbearably
      redundant form containing identical information. If you can, parse the
      resume file, then autofill the parsed text into the wrong form fields -
      but not before mangling whitespace and character encoding.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Request a cover letter</div>
    <p>
      If the job application was a tuxedo, then the cover letter would surely be
      a cummerbund. Accompanying the upload button should be an overtly
      passive-aggressive prompt: "Upload your cover letter here (optional, but
      so is the measles vaccine)".
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      Link their professional accounts
    </div>
    <p>
      Provides no benefit to the candidate whatsoever - but check out those
      sweet oAuth dialog boxes!
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Accept the application</div>
    <p>
      This whole process should have felt like preparing an aged Wagyu steak for
      a food critic. Clicking "submit" should feel like flinging that steak into
      a pit of hyenas.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Thank them for applying</div>
    <p>
      The applicant may have lingering hope upon reaching the final confirmation
      page. Extinguish it. One confirmation message might read, "Thank you for
      having the audacity to apply! Consider yourself lucky should we
      acknowledge you exist."
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Keep your audience waiting</div>
    <p>
      Don't give them any updates for weeks, if at all. Who will appreciate
      hearing back from your company more: Joe Shmoe, or Joe Solitary
      Confinement?
    </p>
    <div className="text-2xl py-2">The Phone Screen</div>
    <p>
      This is a perfect opportunity to see how the candidate deals with
      adversity.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Choose the interviewer</div> <p></p>
    <p>
      An ideal phone interviewer will have many or most of the following
      qualities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Speaks with an accent so thick you could spread it on toast</li>
      <li>
        Converses at a volume and intensity usually reserved for combat radio
        operators
      </li>
      <li>So humorless they could suck the fun out of a Russian wedding</li>
      <li>Mildly ill; interminably coughs, sniffs, or sneezes</li>
      <li>
        Tends to inserts the microphone directly into mouth, achieving maximal
        distortion
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Call and greet the applicant</div>{" "}
    <p>
      Always start off by asking the candidate, "Is this still a good time?"
      Alright, that's enough chit chat. Curtly prod them to submit to the
      interrogation.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Speak your mind</div>
    <p>
      Nothing the candidate says is particularly important. The interviewer
      should always feel free - nay, compelled - to haphazardly cut the
      candidate off and blurt out whatever pops into their head.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Present the prompt</div>
    <p>
      Phone screens are for one thing: evaluating the candidate's ability to
      stay above water with a foot on their head. Go right for the throat with
      an outrageously difficult dynamic programming question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candidate will be nervous about the phone screen time constraints.
      After reading the prompt, let forth a deafening airhorn blast signalling
      them to begin.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Work through the problem</div>
    <p>
      The interviewer should remain quiet for minutes at a time, allowing the
      candidate to silently marinate in anxiety. If the candidate is struggling,
      ask unhelpful questions and recite segments of the prompt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ensure the collaborative code editor you choose has a bright, blinking
      cursor to remind the candidate how little they are typing.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Wrap things up</div>
    <p>
      When the candidate eventually offers a solution and asks for validation,
      fan the flames of their inner doubt by being non-committal and hesitant.
      "Yeah, that's sort of right, I guess that's good enough. Uh oh, looks like
      we're out of time! Do you have any questions?"
    </p>
    <div className="text-2xl py-2" id="takehome">
      The Take-Home Project
    </div>
    <p>
      Like an angry and capricious deity, your company must demand a ritual
      sacrifice from the candidate to be considered worthy.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Selecting the sacrifice</div>
    <p>
      As would a hunter offering their fattest boar, the candidate can honor
      your company by wasting their valuable time with a banal take-home
      project. Have them cast five or six hours onto your sacrificial pyre by
      farting out a CRUDdy Twitter clone skinned with Bootstrap.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Reviewing the submission</div>
    <p>
      You can't be bothered to meaningfully analyze the project, so compensate
      by skimming, nitpicking, and being arbitrary. "
      <i>
        <u>FOUR</u>
      </i>
      space indents? I didn't realize it was amateur hour."
    </p>
    <div className="text-2xl py-2">The Onsite</div>
    <p>
      It's the big day, and you must make a decision at the end of it. Think of
      the candidate as a damp rag; aim to wring them dry before the day is up.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Don't cramp your team's style</div>
    <p>
      When your engineers are preparing questions for onsite candidates, make no
      attempt at oversight. Developing excruciating interview questions is their
      chance to be creative.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the candidate is staring down a graph traversal optimization
      facemelter, they should feel foolish to have ever thought poring over
      Cracking the Coding Interview would help.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Keep them hydrated</div>
    <p>
      Everyone that interacts with the candidate must offer a beverage or a trip
      to the bathroom as many times as possible throughout the day. Bladder
      manipulation is a powerful interrogation tactic.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      Pick the right tools for the job
    </div>
    <p>
      Provide only markers with frayed, mushy tips that go dry after ten
      seconds. This yields a pleasing rainbow program effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purge the room of erasers. This forces the candidate to erase with their
      hands, reminding them that mistakes will be smeared all over them.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Never play to their strengths</div>
    <p>
      "I see your background is in artificial intelligence, you've written your
      own compiler, and you maintain an open source project - how nice. Now
      implement radix sort using only red-black trees."
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Monitor body language</div>
    <p>
      If the candidate is shaking or sweating profusely, it's because they can
      barely contain their excitement for solving problems while you stare at
      them.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Break for lunch</div>
    <p>
      You can learn a lot watching things eat. Pluck the candidate from their
      torture chamber and shove them into an unfamiliar group to eat. One member
      should bring up an inside joke so the everyone except the candidate is
      howling with laughter.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      Schedule a non-technical session
    </div>
    <p>
      Take your foot off the gas from the algorithmic flogging to sit down and
      point out holes in their resume. If the candidate tries to fluff up their
      experience, the interviewer should swoop in and marginalize it. "How many
      people used that product? That's it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Goad the candidate into being arrogant about their expertise, then act
      flabbergasted at their responses.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Chat with executive</div>
    <p>
      If possible, the final session should be a meeting with a company
      executive. You have likely broken the candidate by this point, so the
      executive should feel free to make preposterous claims about the size of
      the company's market and future valuation.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Send them on their way</div>
    <p>
      When the candidate finally departs your office, they should feel like a
      lab monkey being discharged from a research facility that conducts studies
      involving unsolicited electrocution.
    </p>
    <div className="text-2xl py-2">The Offer</div>
    <p>
      You found a candidate that made the cut. Time to lowball the crap out of
      them.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">Call the candidate</div>
    <p>
      The candidate wants to maximize salary, the company wants to minimize
      salary. Normally, this leads to a drawn-out session of nobody wanting to
      play their hand first while remaining coy and aloof. To combat this game
      of salary hot potato, train your recruiters like process servers; teach
      them to trick that number out of the candidate by any means necessary.
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">"Balance" equity and salary</div>
    <p>
      "Do you know what liquidation preference is? No? Then you should take
      mostly equity, it'll be really valuable someday."
    </p>
    <div className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      Pick an expiration date for the offer
    </div>
    <p>
      Selecting a new company to work for is a huge decision for the candidate
      that will significantly impact their life and well-being, potentially for
      years to come.
    </p>
    <p>"So yeah, we need a decision from you by tomorrow."</p>
